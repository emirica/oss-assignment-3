Twofish:
    - symmetric key block cipher
    - block size + key sizes from 128 bits to 256 bits
    - slower for 128-bit keys, faster for 256-bit keys
    - encrypt mode:
        - ECB electronic codebook
        - CBC cipher block chaining
        - CFB cipher feedback
        - OFB output feedback, in 8bit
        - NOFB output feedback, in nbit
    - what it needs:
        - plaintext
        - mode
        - key
        - init vector (pentru mode cele cu feedback)
